### NeuralNetwork
A 2 Layer Neural Network written in python. We will base the network on comparing vectors. 

## Basic Concept/Follow-Along

A neural network is a system that learns to make predictions. Often the input data is
stored in vectors/arrays

Each layer transforms the data from the previous layer. Each layer 'adds value'
